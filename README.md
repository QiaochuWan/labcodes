# Labcodes 

Those codes are for data processing in [Snoke's lab](https://www.snokelab.com/)  
Most of them are based on main gui matlab code of [Jonathan Beaumariage](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/8492801?detail=all)  
More information can be founded in his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jonathanbeaumariage6480/videos)

### What we have now

- Matlab folder has all the code for processing series data after consolidation
- Python folder has the gui for hBN thickness measurement
- Data folder has traning set for SVM algrithm


### What we will have in the future
* Will merge the SVM thickness classifier code into the python gui
* Will create a GUI for matlab processing code for more general data
* Condider to use U-net deep learning algrithm for hBN thickness measurement
* Will add AFM data to the data folder
